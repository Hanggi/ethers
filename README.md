# Ethers For Flutter

![test](https://github.com/Hanggi/ethers/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)

Ethers is a dart library that connects to interact with the Ethereum blockchain and inspired by [ethers.js](https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js/).

Thanks to [web3dart](https://github.com/simolus3/web3dart) which is no longer maintained.

## Installing

Add Ethers to your pubspec.yaml file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  ethers:
```

Import Ethers in files that it will be used:

```yaml
import 'package:ethers/ethers.dart';
```

## Usage

```dart
const provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider('http://localhost:7545');


```
